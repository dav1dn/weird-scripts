created for: hoboween, house halloween party

to make a point where one particular housemate invited literally twice as many people as every other housemate, had to write a script that parsed the event rsvps json data and count them up

json data had to be manually pulled when watching for the http request, then manually formatted cuz it was inside a block of js -- info.json inside is the last one i used. does not contain any sensitive info aside from their friendship relation to me (easily available anyways) as well as their prof pic, which fb will block you from viewing depending on their privacy settings (but prof pics are typically public anyways)
